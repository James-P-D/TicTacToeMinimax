# TicTacToeMinimax

A simple C# WinForms application for playing [Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts &amp; Crosses)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) using the [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm. Not very exciting, but I wanted to tackle an easy game in a language I'm comfortable with before applying Minimax to Connect-4 or Chess in Python or Processing.
